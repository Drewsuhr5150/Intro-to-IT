<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?
 Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>   

<p>I’m heavily into gaming so the generational leap in hardware and graphics over the last 20 years has been spectacular, the necessity/advancement in smartphone and app technology and the new possibilities of learning and recording music.
I guess my interest has steadily grown since about the age of 10 (2000) as the rapid advancements of technology were starting to become a part of my day-to-day life.
The recent lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic caused me to lose both my jobs in the music in the music industry and I thought now was a suitable time for a career change as one industry is slowly dying while the other is continuously growing. 	
No current IT experience that's why I thought this would be a suitable course.</p>

<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
    
<p>Earlier this year I attempted to a Bachelor's degree in Game design - Game programming during the lockdown. I’ve not studied for over a decade and have no prior knowledge in IT, so after completing the first week I felt incredibly confused and overwhelmed. Although a bit defeated, I was not completely deterred and that’s when I came across this course. I choose to go with RMIT because of the flexibility of learning online and RMIT is a very highly regarded education institute.</p>

<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>

<p>I hope to attain the fundamental knowledge needed to start a career in IT and use this course as a pathway to discover which branch of the industry would best suit my work style. Learning to work as part of a team within the IT setting is a focus also.</p>

<h3>A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you. </h3>
<p>A video game programming role working with action/sports games on mobile and console platforms.<br> 
Tasks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designing new systems and implementing them, while improving upon current systems in language C++.</li>  
<li>Self-managed tasks and communicating with the team.</li>   
<li>Bug fixes.</li>    
<li>Improving upon load times, performance & game data.</li>   
</ul>

<h3>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</h3>
<p>A relevant bachelor's degree related to the type of work, a degree in computer science, software engineering is mentioned perhaps also a game specific programming degree.</p>    
<p>A thorough knowledge of C++ and experience in software programming most notably in video games.</p>   
<p>Familiarity with debugging tools, speed, memory and optimisation</p>
<p>Ability to be organised, an eye for detail, good communication skills, work as part of a team, problem solving skills.</p>   
    
<h3>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.</h3>    
<p>My communication and team work skills are up to par but as far as relevant skills specific to this job I have no experience or qualifications in programming.</p>    

<h3>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position. building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.</h3>    
<p>After completing this course I hope to do the ‘Foundations of programming’ course also offered by RMIT, from there I think I’d either like to do a Bachelors in computer science or try something else game design specific again.</p>

<p>Your creativity is a "work in progress." You've had some successes, so now it's time to let loose and stretch yourself. Share your ideas and perspectives with others, and ask them how they view problems. Adopt a collaborative approach to problem finding, and work actively with others to create and innovate. The tools and resources below will help you get to the next level of creativity.</p>

<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h3>    
<p>The results seem fairly accurate in how I view my own strengths and weaknesses, I’m aware that I need to be more decisive in general. It’s not that I can’t find the right solutions more so that I hesitate before making decisions and can’t help but reflect/regret them over and over in my head.</p>   
    
<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>   
<p>I don’t know that these results would influence my behaviour. I’ve found that while sometimes I can let myself down, when I’m working as part of a group I do my most focused work and put in more effort because I would hate for someone to be affected by my lack of work as nothing aggravates me more when it’s done to me.</p>    
    
<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h3>   
<p>I guess just be more open to collaboration and take the time to acknowledge everyone’s input, also be more confident in decision making as generally I’m on the right track I just need to remove some of the anxiety from my mind and not be so hard on myself when my limitations get in the way, just rather learn from it and move on.</p>
